#The Model
I used the model presented in the video lecture.

This includes the state, actuators and update equations.
 
#Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)
reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried.
